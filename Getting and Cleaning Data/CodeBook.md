============================
This is a description of variables involved in the tidy data. Each variable has a stated: type, possible values, and definition.

----------

 - subject_id
	 - Integer variable between 1-30
	 - Unique identifier for a subject in the experiment 
 - activity_type
	 - Factor variable: WALKING, WALKING\_UPSTAIRS, WALKING\_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING
	 - Unique activity identifier
 - timeBodyAcc\_mean_x/y/z
	 - Double variable
	 - Mean of the body acceleration time domain signal over the x/y/z axis, measured by accelerometer
 - timeBodyAcc\_std_x/y/z
	 - Double variable
	 - Standard deviation of the body acceleration time domain signal over the x/y/z axis, measured by accelerometer
 - timeGravityAcc\_mean_x/y/z
	 - Double variable
	 - Mean of the gravity acceleration time domain signal over the x/y/z axis, measured by accelerometer
 - timeGravityAcc\_std_x/y/z
	 - Double variable
	 - Standard deviation of the gravity acceleration time domain signal over the x/y/z axis, measured by accelerometer
 - timeBodyAccJerk\_mean_x/y/z
	 - Double variable
	 - Mean of the body acceleration time domain jerk signal over the x/y/z axis, measured by accelerometer
 - timeBodyAccJerk\_std_x/y/z
	 - Double variable
	 - Standard deviation of the body acceleration time domain jerk signal over the x/y/z axis, measured by accelerometer
