**Getting and Cleaning Data Project**
============================
This is the final project of the course. The goal is to create a tidy data, that can be used for later analysis, from a human activity raw data that was collected by UCI students during [this](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) experiment.
